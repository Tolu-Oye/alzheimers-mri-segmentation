# Alzheimer's MRI Segmentation

This project applies **deep learning techniques (U-Net and U-Net++)** to perform brain MRI segmentation for early detection and analysis of Alzheimer's disease.  
The repository includes preprocessing scripts, model implementations in PyTorch, training workflows, and evaluation metrics.
